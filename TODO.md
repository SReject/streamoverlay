# Bugs
Use-harden the entire project. As you find a bug or 'strange' behavior
**PLEASE** report it. As the project grows in size I'd like for it to also grow
in stability


# Changes
- Move mixer-authorization into its own widget that all other mixer-related widgets will make use of  
- Make pandora's audio output selectable  
- Make pandora pause dependant on scene  
- Make pandorainfo & pandoraspectrum hide/show dependant on scene  


# Planned additions
- Overlay display of alerts(followers, subscribers, hosts)  
- Mixer chat overlay display  
- Mixer chatbot(!! "what do you mean your bot runs in a browser source?!?!")
- More config.js options  
- More configure.html integrations per widget (Enable/disable, styles, positioning, etc)


# Possiblities down the road  
- Donation alert monitoring  
- Tweet alert monitoring  
- Loots integration
- Other platform support such as twitch redbox  
- Remove config.js, base everything on the results of running `/configure.html`  
- More widgets upon suggestion
- Widget-specified dependencies
